%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

%TOC%

<nop>%TOPIC% can be used to build wiki applications that change one or more properties in multiple topics in one transaction.
So users won't have to edit each single topic turn by turn. All changes are submitted to a multi-save backend which then applies them
automatically. By now, only !DataForm properties can be changed. A further version of this extension will allow to change other properties
as well.

This extension is heavily inspired by Foswiki:Extensions/MultiTopicSavePlugin but strips down some of its
features while adding new ones thus rendering its interface incompatible to !MultiTopicSavePlugin. The basic idea how to transmit
a multi-save change still remains similarly.

Rendering of input forms is best delegated to Foswiki:Extensions/FlexFormPlugin which will use the Foswiki's core features to render
!DataForm edit widgets.

---++ Usage

A multi-save form is created using a formatted search like this:

<verbatim class="tml">
<form class="jqMultiSave" name="MyMultiSave">
%DBQUERY{"form='TestForm'"
  header="<table class='foswikiTable'>
    <tr><th>Topic</th><th>Field1</th><th><th>Field2</th><th>Field3</th></tr>$n"
  footer="</table>"
  separator="$n"
  format="<tr><td> [[$web.$topic]] </td><td> 
    $percntRENDERFOREDIT{topic=\"$web.$topic\"
      fields=\"Field1, Field2, Field3\"
      format=\"$edit\"
      separator=\" </td><td> \"
      Field1_name=\"multisave{$web.$topic}{Field1}\"
      Field2_name=\"multisave{$web.$topic}{Field2}\"
      Field3_name=\"multisave{$web.$topic}{Field3}\"
    }$percnt 
    </td></tr>"
}%
%BUTTON{"Save" icon="disk" type="submit"}%
</form>
%JQREQUIRE{"multisave"}%
</verbatim>

There are a couple of things to note:

There's a =%<nop>JQREQUIRE{"multisave"}%= that will load the javascript required to handle all forms having a css class ="jqMultiSave"=
This will attach a jquery.multisave instance to this form.

The multi-save form will be posted to the appropriate jsonrpc endpoint of this extension asynchronously.

Results by the jsonrpc endpoint are processed by the jquery.multisave javascript code and displayed in a message box following the form.

The multi-save action will also transmit the form's name which helps to identify it from other multi-save wiki applications in subsequent =beforeSaveHandler= and =afterSaveHandler= (see below).

The formatted search in the example looks up topics that have a specific !TestForm attached to it. In this example !TestForm comprises of at least three formfield Field1, Field2, Field3.

The formatted search makes use of !FlexFormPlugin's %RENDERFOREDIT macro that will generate the edit interface based on the !DataForm definition of !TestForm.

The form elements used to edit each formfield requires it's =name= attribute to be altered in a specific way so that <nop>%TOPIC% knows where to save this formfield. 
It must be of the form 

<verbatim>multisave{web.topic}{fieldname}</verbatim>

For instance, the Field1_name parameter in the example above will override the normal =name= attribute used by
%RENDERFOREDIT while creating an edit widget for that element. So changing =Field1= in a topic <nop>FooWeb.BarTopic will performed by
an form element such as:

<verbatim class="tml">
<input type="text" size="75" name="multisave{FooWeb.BarTopic}{Field1}" value="..." />
</verbatim>

All form elements that changed their values will be flagged so using css automatically. Only these will be transferred to the multi-save backend.
